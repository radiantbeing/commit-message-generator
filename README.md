[Demo](https://git-commit-message-generator.vercel.app/)

## Prerequisites

- The Git Commit Message Generator operates in conjunction with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).
- It requires the [`mistral`](https://ollama.ai/library/mistral) model, which is compatible with Ollama. If you don't have this model, run the following command:

  ```shell
  ollama run mistral
  ```
